Interesting answer:
Yes, of course, without any tools mentioned in the other answers, but simply using the C++ compiler.

just follow these steps from within your C++ program (on linux, but must be similar on other OS)

write a C++ program into a file (e.g. in /tmp/prog.cc), using an ofstream
compile the program via system("c++ /tmp/prog.cc -o /tmp/prog.so -shared -fPIC");
load the program dynamically, e.g. using dlopen()

After reading DSP book (not Oppenheim) I thought to myself:
 consider doing bit depth conversion by using round-to-nearest.
